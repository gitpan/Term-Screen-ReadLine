0.37 -- Fixed bug #12096: Automated testing issues

0.36 -- Applied patch by anonymous
	66522 	overwrite rather than remove characters on initialisation

0.35 -- Fixed a circumstantial BUG. 
	 -- The getch() function will result in a race condition, in certain situations.
        Notably, when a telnet window is being killed without terminating the program, which
        results in a 'floating tty bound program', that keeps the CPU at 100%.

 	    The problem has been solved, by checking for ord($c)==0 in the getch() function,
        and using an exit 100, when this condition occures.

0.34 -- Removed debugging information.

0.33 -- Some internal changes.
     -- notably the setstr() function to make a string of '*' characters.

0.32 -- Converted all files to UNIX format.

0.30 -- Made test.pl better structured test.
     -- With test.pl, debugged ReadLine.pm.
     -- Changed Makefile.PL to contain dependency to Term::Screen
     -- Extended readline() function with PASSWORD functionality.

0.20 -- First version.
